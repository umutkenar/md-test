Held in Dubai from November 30 to December 12, under the presidency of the United Arab Emirates, COP28 faced challenges in reaching an agreement, causing it to extend one day beyond the official schedule.

In a text that, for the first time in the approximately 30-year history of climate negotiations, makes reference to "fossil fuels," a call for "moving away from fossil fuels" is emphasized to limit temperature rise.

The term "call," as recognized by the United Nations, implies an invitation or request to the parties. Experts point out that the call to move away from fossil fuels is considered a weak outcome, raising doubts about achieving sharp reductions in emissions to limit global warming.

In addition to accepting goals to triple global renewable energy capacity by 2030 and double progress in energy efficiency, the parties reached an agreement on the operationalization of the Loss and Damage Fund, as outlined in the final text.

Despite references to the financial needs of developing countries for climate financing and the funding required for adapting to the impacts of climate change in the final text, uncertainties remain regarding the scaling of adaptation financing and its timeline.

COP28 President Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, speaking at the closing session after the acceptance of the final text, described the outcome of the negotiations as a "historic success." He stated, "The world needed to find a new path, and by following our northern star, we have found this new path. We confronted the facts and directed the world in the right direction. In this regard, we have developed an action plan to make the goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees achievable." Al Jaber emphasized that this plan is science-led and is a balanced, historic package that addresses emissions, fills gaps in adaptation, and redesigns global financing.

UNFCCC Executive Secretary Simon Stiell urged all governments and businesses to translate their commitments into action without delay. He commented, "COP28 was a moment where a strong stand against the fundamental climate issue facing humanity was necessary. We did not close the era of fossil fuels in Dubai, but today's result marks the beginning of the end for fossil fuels."

COP28 President Sultan Ahmed al-Jaber, in today's session, approved the main document serving as a global inventory demonstrating how far the world is deviating from and how it can return to climate goals without seeking commentary. Following the approval, delegates celebrated this decision by embracing each other.

The agreement calls for a fair, orderly, and equitable transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems over the critical next 10 years, instead of a gradual phasing out of fossil fuels.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, in his speech during COP28, underscored the importance of focusing on combating fossil fuel production and consumption, identified as the root cause of the climate crisis. Guterres issued a call for an agreement to "gradually phase out" all fossil fuels.
