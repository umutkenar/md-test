##### The Importance of COP28:

COP28 aims to revitalize the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius set in the 2015 Paris Agreement. According to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the 1.5 degree target is critical for the world to be less affected by the climate crisis.

Long-term warming, currently around 1.1-1.2 degrees, could rise to 2.4-2.7 degrees by 2100. Therefore, accelerating the transition to clean energy and providing financial assistance to poor countries in the coming years is vital to reach the 1.5 degree target.
