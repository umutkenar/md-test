#### The **United Nations** (UN) Climate Conference [(COP27)](https://cop27.eg/#/) brought together world leaders in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, from 6 to 18 November to discuss the measures to be taken to combat the climate crisis. This year, the climate summit, which covered important topics, was also important in terms of being held after a year of climate disasters and record temperatures.


#### Agreement at COP27!

The congress ended with a delay of 2 days, as the delegates of 200 countries working for the climate crisis and sustainable life, who came together within the framework of the program, reached an agreement after 48 hours of additional negotiations. Significant progress has been made with this landmark agreement to provide loss and damage financing for vulnerable countries most affected by climate disasters, creating a special fund for loss and damage, adding the issue to the official agenda and adopting it for the first time.

Developing countries that have been unfairly affected by the climate crisis have been struggling for nearly 30 years to compensate for the loss and damage they have suffered. This agreement was expressed as an important step taken by developed countries that have long resisted to provide funding to cover climate impacts such as floods and droughts.


#### Ecolarium at COP27!

**Ecolarium**, which offers solutions based on blockchain technology for the climate crisis at COP27, which expresses the most effective and powerful management of the process towards the climate crisis, was invited to convey the importance and purpose of the project within the scope of the summit.

The inevitable fact that the climate crisis affects everyone also reveals the fact that everyone has a say in the future life. In this context, the CMO of the project, Harun Sarıkurt, came together with the COP27 participants to explain the Ecolarium project, which aims to create a sustainable future for everyone with the unity of technology and nature.

Ecolarium, which aims to find solutions to the climate crisis by making use of blockchain technology, won the intense interest and support of the participants. Within the scope of the summit, Ecolarium CMO Harun Sarıkurt shared the future vision of the project in the fields of sustainability, carbon credits and actions that can be taken with blockchain technology against the climate crisis.
